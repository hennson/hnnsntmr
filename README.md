# hnnsntmr
A Time Timer in a simple HTML, JS and CSS way. A useful alternative if you forget the time timer at home . 

The HNNSNTMR is a countdown clock based on the brilliant analogous Time Timer that uses a pink disc (but a red in the original version) to visually illustrate how much time is left for your task, challenge, game or whatever. To activate the timer, the disc is set counterclockwise to the desired time by clicking the timesteps or entering a value in the textbox. When the time has expired, the pink disc disappears, and an alarm sound is played.
